Exercise: hand
5.0/5.0 points (graded)

ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE: 14 minutes

In this problem, you'll be asked to read through an object-oriented implementation of the hand from the word game problem of Problem Set 4. You'll then be asked to implement one of its methods. Note that the implementation of the object-oriented version of the hand is a bit different than how we did things with the functional implementation; pay close attention to doc strings and read through the implementation carefully.

To begin: Download hand.py((https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/e2f8b32f7d45af6f662b67184ffcd229/asset-v1:MITx+6.00.1x+2T2018+type@asset+block/hand.py)) and read through the file. Be sure to understand what's going on in the file. Make a few instances of the Hand class, and play around with the existing methods.

When you have completed reading through the file, implement the update method.

Paste the entire Hand class in the box below.

The __str__ method is this:

    def __str__(self):
        '''
        Display a string representation of the hand.
        '''
        output = ''
        hand_keys = self.hand.keys()
        hand_keys.sort()
        for letter in hand_keys:
            for j in range(self.hand[letter]):
                output += letter
        return output
A more concise version of this code might be

    def __str__(self):
        '''
        Display a string representation of the hand.
        '''
        output = ''
        for letter in sorted(self.hand.keys()):
            output += letter * self.hand[letter]
        return output
Use whichever __str__ method you like. This will make sure the grading of the hand's display is consistent.
